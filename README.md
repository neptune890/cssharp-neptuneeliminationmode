<h1>Neptune Elimination Mode Plugin</h1><br/>
<p>Neptune Elimination Mode is a custom plugin for Counter-Strike 2, built using CounterStrikeSharp. This mod introduces a unique elimination mode where players killed by an opponent will respawn if that opponent dies. The plugin tracks player eliminations dynamically and ensures the game round ends as normal when an entire team is eliminated. Designed for competitive and custom gameplay, this plugin enhances tactical decision-making and replayability.</p>
